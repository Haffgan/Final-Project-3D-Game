## 3.	Grand Story line

After the death of the Old King, he left two sons: the eldest son - Invar and the younger - Arthur.

Power was inherited by the eldest son. At the same time Invar became interested in Black magic and plunged the kingdom of Etheria into the abyss of chaos and poverty.

The youngest son, who was a good warrior, a valiant man, with the help of associates in the castle, was able to seize power and arrest the cruel king. But it was not possible to execute the dark sorcerer, he escaped from custody, using black magic and disappeared into the forests.

For 5 years nothing was heard about him, until recently, rumours reached the castle that gangs of magical creatures began to terrorize the surrounding villages.

3 days ago, the young Arthur received the letter that a large army of trolls had gathered in the southern forests of the kingdom and they were preparing to move north, to the capital. Robbing along the way and killing everyone in their path. The young King decided to personally lead the defence of his lands and moved to the scene of the battle.
The first battle took place in the southern lands, in a gorge formed by the bed of a dried river. The young king, for whom this was the first real battle, got the opportunity to show his force and skills.

But the brave king did not realize that it was nothing but a distraction. Because the main enemy forces, summoned by the disappeared older brother Invar, gathered at the time in the north side of the kingdom. Not far from the capital, to bring down all their cruel power to the main castle of Etheria.
